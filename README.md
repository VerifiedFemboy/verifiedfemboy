# Welcome To My Github Profile! ðŸ˜¸ 

## Introduce
Hello! My name is Maciek, and I am a 18-year-old developer from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±. Despite being deaf, my passion for programming and creating innovative projects drives me forward every day. I have a deep love for animals, especially cats, and I find joy in their companionship.

In addition to my programming endeavors, I am also fascinated by the world of physics and astronomy. I love exploring the mysteries of the universe. My appreciation for beauty extends to nature as well, where I adore beautiful pink flowers.

Currently, I am honing my skills in the Rust programming language and eagerly awaiting the release of Carbon language from Google. Even though I am deaf, I enjoy listening to music, finding unique ways to experience and appreciate it.

I am always excited to learn new things and push the boundaries of what I can create with technology.
